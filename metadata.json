    "Title": "Variational autoencoder for small molecule generation",
    "Description": "This variational autoencoder (VAE) for chemistry uses an encoder-decoder-predictor framework to predict new small molecules. The input SMILES molecule is converted into a continuous vector, and the decoder converts this molecular representation back to a discrete SMILES. These continuous molecular representations allow for simple operations to generate new chemical matter. The decoder is constrained to produce valid molecules. In addition, a predictor estimates the chemical properties of the molecules represented as continuous vectors (logP, QED, synthetic accessibility). The chemicalVAE was trained on 250k drugs from ZINC.\n",
